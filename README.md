## From Hilton README

## Assessment 1:

Expected final output:
HTML/CSS/JS/supporting images.

Description:
A hotel details web page is going to be served to web users. A screenshot of the mobile version is provided of what it should look like (test1-mobile-page.png). Create a static web page from scratch that matches the screenshot, with some responsiveness for varying phone screen sizes. (The footer is not illustrated - feel free to cut off however you feel appropriate). Supporting images for this test can be found in /test1_assets/ directory.

The point of this is to show awareness towards:

- Design detail
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/responsive design
