# Hilton Assessment 1
This is my submission for the Hilton UI Assessment.

## From Hilton README
Assessment 1:
--------------
Expected final output:
HTML/CSS/JS/supporting images.

Description:
A hotel details web page is going to be served to web users.  A screenshot of the mobile version is provided of what it should look like (test1-mobile-page.png).  Create a static web page from scratch that matches the screenshot, with some responsiveness for varying phone screen sizes.  (The footer is not illustrated - feel free to cut off however you feel appropriate).  Supporting images for this test can be found in /test1_assets/ directory.

The point of this is to show awareness towards:
- Design detail
- Semantic HTML 
- CSS/responsive design
